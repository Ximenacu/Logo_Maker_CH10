## Description 
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. 
The parameters you can change from the logo are: 
* Logo text (up to three characters) and color.
* Logo Shape (circle, triangle, square) and color.

It uses the NPM Inquirer to collect input from the user and Jest for running unit tests. 

It was developed with the intention of saving developers time and the money the would pay a graphic designer to make logos for their projects.
